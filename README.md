# Yelp_review_prediction
This project uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's Yelp Business Rating Prediction competition to predict the Rating based on reviews published by people.

## Introduction

This exercise uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's Yelp Business Rating Prediction competition.

## Description of the data:

yelp.csv contains the dataset. It is stored in the repository (in the data directory), so there is no need to download anything from the Kaggle website.
Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.
The stars column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.
The text column is the text of the review.
### Goal: Predict the star rating of a review using only the review text.
